## Class Overview

- By the end of this class, you should:
    - Be comfortable in working with R, including most common geospatial functions
    - Have a good sense of where R is headed as a language
    - Know where to look when don't know how to do something
    - Be using R as part of a ___reproducible___ workflow

- Course approach
    - (Largely) flipped model and emphasis on problem solving
        - Programming should be fun! (or at least intriguing)
    - Lab and office hours as help sessions

---

## Reproducibility 1

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_1.png")
```

---

## Reproducibility 2
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_2.png")
```
---

## Course Requirements

- Let's have a look at the [Syllabus](`r here::here("vignettes/syllabus.html")`)

---

## Changes

- `sf` replaced `sp`
- `raster` about to be replaced by `stars` or `terra`
- R's syntax is evolving

---

## Getting Set Up

- Get yourself a GitHub account, if you haven't
- Send us your GitHub name
- Install `git` on your local computer(s)
- Set up your [personal access token](`r here::here("vignettes/help.html")`)
- Install the `geospaar` library
- Learn how to create your own github repo under the [\@agroimpacts\/geog246346 team](https://github.com/agroimpacts)
