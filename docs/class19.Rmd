## Project

Requirements:

- Assignment 6 (project proposal): section 3 assessment in https://agroimpacts.github.io/geospaar/projects.html#assignment
- Project (presentation and report): section 1.3 and 1.4 in https://agroimpacts.github.io/geospaar/assessment.html

Milestones:

- We do presentation in this room on May 26, 2021.
- Final repo should be submitted on or before midnight on May 31, 2021.

## Project

Name:

- Keep the name short and meaningful (e.g. use `agroclim` for Analyzing agro-climatological data)
- Camel Style (`agroClim`) and special character (`agro_clim`) is also commonly used. But personally I don't recommend to use these. Because R is case sensitive, it will increase the risk for the user to misspell it.

## Project

Data

- Raw data: it is inevitable to use some messy data for your project. If this is the case, you could first clean the raw data and then save out as prepared data for your project.

  - `usethis::use_data_raw(name = 'ghana')`, it will generate a folder and an R file, then you update code here.
  - Run the code will create data folder and generate `rda` file into it.
  - Then you could use these data by using `data(ghana)` in your code. Remember to document your dataset.
  
- External data: Store data into `inst` folder (could have sub folders inside).

---

## Project

Scripts

- Functions: don't do duplicated work. If a chunk of code is used more than one time, consider to pack it into a function. I recommend to use functions.

- Vignettes: use `usethis::use_vignette('Overview')` to create. It is better to customize the format of your vignette.

- If there are other documents that you want to include, you could create a folder notebooks to store these documents.

---

## Strategies

Huge files

- Avoid store the files as much as possible. E.g. use code to download directly.
- Let git ignore big files: list file path into `.gitignore` file. If you accidentally add file into Git already, do the following to remove it from git track first and then add to `.gitignore`.

  `git rm --cache file_path`

---

## Strategies

If it takes too long to run the code on fly, we could cheat a bit. Save out necessary outputs and load results back. E.g.
  
  - Assume you have a code chunk, set `eval = F` for this chunk to generate result ahead and just show the code in markdown.
    ```
    do something here
    obj <- ...
    save(obj, file = 'file_path.rda')
    ```
  - Then add another chunk, set `echo = F` for this chunk to just read the file and not show the code in markdown.
    ```
    load('file_path.rda')
    ```
---

## Strategies

Sometimes, the results are still huge that exceed the file limitation of GitHub. Then we could directly generate result figures and just show the figures in markdown. E.g.

```{r, eval = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(raster)
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(rnaturalearth)
gha <- ne_countries(continent = 'africa', returnclass = 'sf') %>%
  filter(name == 'Ghana')
rainfall <- getData(name = 'worldclim', var = 'prec', res = 2.5) %>% 
  calc(., mean)
rainfall <- mask(crop(rainfall, gha), gha)

png(here('docs/figures/rainfall.png'))
tm_shape(rainfall) + 
  tm_raster(title = 'Rainfall',
            breaks = seq(60, 180, 10),
            palette = "-RdYlGn", 
            n = length(seq(60, 180, 10)))
dev.off()
```

---

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', message=F, warning=F}
# set echo=FALSE for this chunk
# include_graphics does not like here.
knitr::include_graphics('figures/rainfall.png')
```

---

## Strategies

More functions to save out figures. E.g.

- `tmap_save` for `tmap`
- `ggsave` for `ggplot2`

---

## Strategies

Keep the `main` branch updated. Merge new changes to main branch and test the installation of your package periodically.

Rule of thumb:
- It doesn't make sense to keep work on different branch separately. Create a branch based on the objective, e.g. `prepare_data`. 
- After finishing all work, merge the updates to `main` branch.
- Delete branch `prepare_data`.
- Of course, team members could work on different branch simultaneously.

---

## Class arrangement

- Monday: a time to have a weekly report group by group
- Wednesday: a time of discussion and question
- Office hours and labs: help sections
- We could schedule meetings beyond class time if necessary

---

## Homework

- Assignment 6 is due this Friday. More details on section 3 Assignment in [Semester Projects](https://agroimpacts.github.io/geospaar/projects.html).
