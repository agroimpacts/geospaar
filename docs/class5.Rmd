- Getting help.
- Git/GitHub

## Today

- Indexing and subsetting
- Introduction to `dplyr`

---

### Create your own data

Create the following 1-d structures:
- `a`: a random vector of integers with 10 elements drawn from 1-20:
  - Use the `sample` function with `set.seed(10)`
  - Name the elements of `a` with a vector of names starting with "V1" and ending with "V10". 
      - Use the `paste0` function to create those names.
      - Create the identical vector of names using the `paste` function.
- `b`: Using `a` as an index to select from `letters`
- `d`: a random vector of integers with 10 elements from a normal distribution with a mean = 100 and an sd of 20:
  - Use `rnorm` function with `set.seed(12)`.
- Create a list `l` from `a`, `b`, `d`. 
    - Assign the name "a", "b", and "d" for the corresponding `l`'s element.

---

### Create your own data

Create the following 2-d structures:
- `m`: a matrix with three integer columns named "V1", "V2", "V3"
  - Create each column first as its own vector, then combine
  - `V1` is 1:10
  - `V2` is a random sample between 1:100
  - `V3` is drawn from a random uniform distribution between 0 and 50     
  - Use the same `set.seed(50)` as before
  - Inspect the `str` and `class` of `m`
- `dat`, a data.frame built from `V1`, `V2`, `V3`, and `V4`
  - `V4` is a random selection of the letters A-E, use the same seed as above

## Indexing

- Vectors

  * A vector of positive number(s), e.g. `x[c(1, 3, 5)]`
  * A vector of negative number(s), e.g. `x[-c(1:2)]`
  * A vector of names, e.g. `x[c('name1', 'name3')]`
  * A vector of logical, e.g. `x[c(F, T, T, F)]`. But be careful of the length.
  * Nothing, e.g. `x[]`. Got a full vector
  * Zero, e.g. `x[0]`. Got a vector with length 0

Be careful of the length of the index vector!!

---

## Indexing

- Array/Matrix

  * Each dimension is the same as vector indexing.
  * Matrix `m[row, col]`, the thing before comma is row, and the thing after comma is the col.
  * Array `a[row, col, higher-dim]`.
  * E.g. `m[1:3, ]` or `a[c(1, 3, 4), , c(T, F, F, T)]`.
  
- List

  * If we take each item within a list as a list, all vector indexing could work on list. E.g. `l[1]`, `l[1:3]`, `l[c(T, F, T)]`, `l[c('name1', 'name3')]`.
  * But every time we will still get a **list** return.
  * In order to get a simple vector, we could use `[[]]` or `$`. E.g. `l[[1]]` or `l[1][[1]]`, `l[['id']]`, `l$id`.
  * `[[]]` only can get one item from a list as a vector each time.

---

## Indexing
### Data.frame

- The matrix syntax `df[row, col]` works for data.frame.
- The list syntax also works, but the columns of data.frame correspond to elements of list. E.g. `df[col]`, `df[c('col_name')]`.
- The `[[]]` and `$` syntax to get the simple vector also works. E.g. `df[1][[1]]`, `df[['id']]`, `df$id`.

---

## Changing values

All indexing methods to get the values out can also be used to change values by just assigning new values.

---

## Useful summary functions

Only works for numbers:

- `rowsSums`
- `colSums`
- `rowMeans`
- `colMeans`

---

### 1-d Indexing/subsetting/replacing

- Select the 1st, 2nd, and 10th elements from `a`
- Select the elements of `a` named V1, V2, V3 (use the names)
- Replace the second to last value of `a` with the word "sasquatch"
    - Use code to find the index value, not the actual integer value of the index
- Select from `b` the values "c", "d", "e" if there is any (`%in%`)
- Identify the index position in `b` of values "c", "d", "e" if there is any
- Select the first 5 values of `d` and the last 5 values of `d` into two separate vectors and multiply them.
- Select from `d` all values > 100:
    - How many values are there?
- Select from `d` all values between 95 and 105, and replace them with 100
- Repeat steps 1, 3, 4, and 8 above, but do it by accessing `a`, `b`, and `d` from `l`

---

### 2-d Indexing/subsetting/replacing
- Select the first 10 values from `m`, using a single vector and no row or column information
- Use a single vector to select the last row, column value from `m`
- Replace the value selected in 2 above with -99
- Now select row 3, columns 1:2 from `m`, and replace them with their values multiplied by 10
- Do the same, but select the columns by their name, and reset the new values by dividing by 10
- Select from `dat` the values of V3, and square them. Do it using index notation, column name in `[]`, and `$`
- Subset the first two rows and columns of `dat` into a new data.frame `datss`.
- Replace `dat` rows 1:2, column 1:2 with the values -1:-4
- Reset the part of `dat` you just changed with the values in `datss`

---

## Introduction to `dplyr`

- `select` and `filter` function for subsetting
- `mutate` function for adding or replacing
- pipeline `%>%`

```{r, eval=F}
data(iris)
# start with tabular data
iris_filtered <- as_tibble(iris) %>% 
  filter(Petal.Width > 0.5) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Species, Sepal.Length) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:nrow(.))

# Or start with the first function
iris_filtered <- filter(iris, Petal.Width > 0.5) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Species, Sepal.Length) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:nrow(.))
```

## Homework

- Finish the practice if you didn't yet.
- Read Unit1-Module4 "Data preparation" to learn `dplyr` syntax.
- Finish class 5 challenge in Week 3 homework to practice `dplyr` and push your markdown to your assignment repo (Please put it in a separate folder "homework", not "vignettes"). We will discuss the code next class.
