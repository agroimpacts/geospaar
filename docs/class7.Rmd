## We have learned

- Fundamentals of R.
- Functions, packages, environment, and namespace.
- Reproducibility.
- Getting help.
- Git/GitHub
- Indexing, subsetting, and replacing
- `*apply` family
- `tidyverse`

---

## Today

- Read, write data and paths
- More on data manipulation
- Tables

---

## Read and write data

- Base R:
  
  - `read.csv` (argument `stringsAsFactors = F`) and `write.csv`
  
- `readr` package in `tidyverse` family (much faster):

  - `read_csv` and `write_csv`

---

## Paths

- Interactive environment (e.g. console):
  
  - `getwd()` to get the working directory
  - `setwd()` to set the new working directory
  - relative paths are relative to this working directory.
  
- R markdown knit directory:

  - Document directory
  - Project directory
  - Current working directory
  
- R script

  - Current working directory

---

## Strategies to work with paths
  
- Check, create, or delete directory/file

  - `dir.exists()` and `file.exists()` to check if a directory or file exists.
  - `dir.create()` to create a directory.
  - `unlink()` to delete a folder with arguments `recursive = T` based on needs.
  - `file.remove()` or `file.rename()` to delete or rename a file.
  
- List files/folders within a directory:

  - `list.files()` to list files with arguments `pattern` or `full.names` based on needs.
  - `list.dirs()` to list folders. Works similar to `list.files()`

---

## Strategies to work with paths

Package `here` will definitely what you should try.

- Function `here` of package `here` will specify the right path of a file within a project:
  
  - `here::here()` will give you the project root path
  - `here::here("/a/path/relative/to/your/project/root")` to specify the right path of a file within your package.
  
---

## Others

- `download.file()` to download a file using url.
- `unzip()` to extract files from a compressed file.

---

## Data manipulation
### Reshaping

- `pivot_longer()` in `tidyr` package.
- `pivot_wider()` in `tidyr` package.

---

## Data manipulation
### Renaming

- `rename()` in `dplyr` package.

---

## Data manipulation
### Combining

- `*_join` function in `dplyr` package.
- The magic of `do.call()`, `rbind` and `lapply`.

---

## Tables

Package [`kableExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)

Basic syntax is:

```{r, eval=F}
dt %>%
  kbl() %>% # feed data in `kableExtra`
  kable_paper() %>% # set template
  column_spec() %>% # reformat selected columns if necessary
  row_spec() # reformat selected rows if necessary
```

---

## Next class

- Figures!!

  - Base plot
  - `ggplot2`: make sure you learn the syntax before next class. We will directly learn it with some tasks.

---

## Homework

- Finish class 7 `table` challenge in Week 4 homework. Still push your markdown to your assignment repo within folder homework.
- Read the visualization part of Unit1-Module4 and `ggplot2` cheatsheet listed in cheatsheets in our class homepage.
