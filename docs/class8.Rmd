## Base plot

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=3, eval=F}
x <- 1:20
y <- sin(x)
plot(x, y,
     col = c('blue', 'orange'), # color, could be one or more.
     type = 'o', # the type of this plot. Details in help documentation. 
     pch = c(20, 5, 3), # shape of points, could be one or more.
     cex = 1.5, # the size of points
     lty = 3, lwd = 2, # line style and width
     main = "This is a figure", # define title
     sub = "Sin curve", # a sub title
     col.main = 'red', # set color for title
     xlab = "Time", # title of X axis
     ylab = "Value") # title of Y axis
# Add a line to an existing plot
abline(h = 0.5, col = 'green', lwd = 2, lty = 10) 
# Add a legend, have to set everything manually.
# Details in help document.
legend('bottomright', # position
       inset = 0.05, # adjust position
       c("Sin","A line"), 
       lwd = 2,
       lty = c(3, 10),
       col = c("blue", "green"),
       title="Graph type")
```

## Base plot

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=5, dpi=600}
x <- 1:20
y <- sin(x)
plot(x, y,
     col = c('blue', 'orange'), # color, could be one or more.
     type = 'o', # the type of this plot. Details in help documentation. 
     pch = c(20, 5, 3), # shape of points, could be one or more.
     cex = 1.5, # the size of points
     lty = 3, lwd = 2, # line style and width
     main = "This is a figure", # define title
     sub = "Sin curve", # a sub title

legend('bottomright', # position
       inset = 0.05, # adjust position
       c("Sin","A line"), 
       lwd = 2,
       lty = c(3, 10),
       col = c("blue", "green"),
       title="Graph type")
```

## Base plot

More choices on style of points or lines:

- `pch`: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r
- `lty`: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/line-types-in-r-lty

---

## Histogram
```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%", dpi=200}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(1000)
hist(x, col = c('red'), 
     border = c('blue'),
     main = 'Normal distribution',
     breaks = 10,
     xlab = 'Value')
```

---

## Others

- `boxplot`
- `par(mfrow = c(1, 3))` to organize multiple points.

Very good examples of [base plotting system](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/84527_6b8334fd3d9348579681b24d156e7e9d.html).

---

## Practice

Use the dataset `airquality`, everyone makes a figure and shares the code and the figure in slack.

## `ggplot2`

Details in [`ggplot2` package document](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).

- Basic syntax

An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. It includes things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. So if you want `ggplot2` to take your settings of these things, you have to put them into aesthetic.

```{r, eval=F}
my_plot <- ggplot(dt, aes(x = ., y = ., fill = ., color = ., ...)) + # Data
  geom_point(aes(...)) +# geom
  ... +
  facet_wrap() + # organize sub-plots
  # scale
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "blue", ...)) + # customize fill color
  scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "green", ...)) + # customize color
  ylab() + xlab() + ggtitle() + # titles
  coord_polar() + # sometimes you might want to change the coordinate system
  theme_bw() # ggplot2 theme
```

---

## Some geom functions in `ggplot2`

- `geom_point()`: scatter plot
- `geom_line()`: line plot
- `geom_histogram()`: histogram
- `geom_bar()`: bar plot with base on the x-axis
- `geom_boxplot()`: standard box plot with boxes and whiskers
- `geom_smooth()`: smooth curve

## Next class

We are done for Unit 1!! From next unit, we will get our hands dirty with geospatial data.

- Class 9: review what we have learned so far with a case study.
- Class 10: review some basic concepts of GIS.

---

## Homwork

- Assignment 2 is due this Friday.
- Review some concepts of geospatial data:
  - Vector vs. raster. And their common file types.
  - Coordinate System. Geographic coordinate system and Cartesian coordinate system.
  - Projection and transformation.
  - Geodatabase and attributes of vectors
