# Overview
If you have these software installed before, it's recommended to upgrade to the most current stable version.

# Installation
## Step 1: Install Git
Go to [Installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instruction to install Git for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).

## Step 2: Install R
Go to [R page](https://www.r-project.org) and download the current stable release, R 4.0.3, using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).

## Step 3: Install RStudio Desktop
Go to [RStudio page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the current stable release, RStudio-1.4.1103, using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).

## Step 4: Install RTools (Windows only)
Windows machine needs RTools to build some packages from source. It is better to install it beforehand. Go to [RTools page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to read the instruction, then download and install.

## Step 5: Install GDAL
GDAL is a widely used library for geospatial data. A lot of R geospatial packages rely on it. The way to install is very different for different operating systems:

- Windows: go this [page](https://gdal.org/download.html) to download and install the current stable version.

- Mac: a bit trickier, but probably best is to install  [frameworks](https://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks/). If you use homebrew often, you also could use homebrew formula to install: `brew install gdal`.

- Linux: If you use a Linux machine, try to search the tutorial online for your operating systems to install. For example, GDAL is available for Ubuntu from the [UbuntuGIS-Stable PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ppa?field.series_filter=xenial). Let's solve together if you got any issues.
